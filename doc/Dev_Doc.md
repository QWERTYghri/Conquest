Notes

**1/24/23**

Currently there is plans for only one playing mode which is single player. However I am planning for some sort of way
for multiplayer. Perhaps the ability to set up a server and have people join it. But I'd have to plan the single player
build to accomodate that plan which really isn't thought out much.
