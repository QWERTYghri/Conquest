==========================================
This is a reference of notes to be used
for specific details of the game structure
and the ncurses panels and data structure.
=========================================

GIT BRANCHES
===========================================
main : Final shit like your typical main
dev-build : Design optimization build
pro-build : Prototyping build, literally playing with code until it works

NCURSES SCREEN
==============

I wanted to use colors in the display for the game
which although would break some sense of compatability
with terminals that don't support colors.

Main Menu
--------------
stdscr will be blue

A ratio screen will be made centered on the terminal size COLS and LINES.
Size will be -30 cells less than the terminal size

This window should be gray and boxes with black. A second backdrop window will be behind it and
act as a shadow behind it.

A center text menu will be made and will be highlighted with A_REVERSE A_BOLD and white colored
You can circulate through the text options with arrow keys or [jk] [hl] or [up down] [left right].

The center text should have a play option, help option, and exit

implementation menu:
        Have a function that prints in a specified location and circulates a char* array.
        Everytime an arrow key or hjkl is pressed it prints the array and depending on a var int
        that the arrow keys change, on a specific char it prints it differently to the attributes.

        Depending on the int val that was used in the choice var it executes a function that
        handles the label for it.

        The play option prints over the grey window with difficulty options.
        The difficulty choice loads different values into global vars that affect the increment.

        Then it fires the game function to load the main game.
        
        The help function open a menu to view info on how the game works. You can press enter to close it.

        Quit just calls an exit and endwin.

The menu displays a side panel to move around up and down to select a different attribute to view. It follows the same set as
